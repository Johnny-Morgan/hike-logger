- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme

    I used a green with brown colour scheme for this project which I obtained from [schemecolor](https://www.schemecolor.com/green-with-brown-color-combination.php).
    This palette has 5 colors which are Caf√© Noir (#543B23), Pastel Brown (#846954), White Coffee (#DFDFD4), June Bud (#A5D74D) and Dark Lemon Lime (#81BE1C).

  - #### Typography

    [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was chosen as the main font for this website with sans-serif as the fallback font.
